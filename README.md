# Branching_fixed
Branching Analysis of fixed neurons measured via NeuronJ

used in Brosig et. al, 2019, Cell reports, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.039

Goals:

   - primary summary statistics for each neuron (Numbers and lengths of all categories)
   - secondary statistic for each neuron (Branches / length, Mean lengths, Total lengths, Axon/Dendrite Ratio)
   - Create summary Figures
 
requires data created through: ImageJ plugin NeuronJ - tracing measurements exported as .txt or .csv
